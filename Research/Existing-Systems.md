### **Functional Limitations**

**No Accommodation Matching** - Cannot filter jobs by specific workplace adjustments or employer accessibility ratings.[5][9]

**Limited Feature Integration** - No platform combines comprehensive accessibility with advanced job matching algorithms.[9][5]

**Geographic Restrictions** - Most specialized platforms serve limited regions, leaving global markets underserved.[6][7]

**Technology Lag** - Existing systems don't leverage modern web technologies for enhanced accessibility features.[3][9]

## **User Experience Problems**

**High Abandonment Rates** - Complex interfaces cause disabled users to abandon job applications mid-process.[4][2]

**Discrimination Concerns** - Users hesitate to disclose disabilities due to lack of inclusive employer verification.[5][9]

**Support Gaps** - No integrated help systems or accessibility guidance for job search process.[3][9]

**Mobile Inaccessibility** - Poor mobile experience for users relying on smartphones with assistive technology.[2][4]

## **Opportunity for Innovation**

The existing system analysis reveals significant gaps in accessibility implementation, disability-specific features, and comprehensive job matching capabilities, creating a clear opportunity for an innovative solution that addresses these limitations through modern web technologies and inclusive design principles.[9][5]

This analysis demonstrates why a new, purpose-built accessible job portal is needed to serve the 26.8 million disabled individuals in India and similar populations globally.[10][9]
